# Discrete Mathematics Honors Project

Welcome to the repository for my Discrete Mathematics Honors Project! In this project, I explored and implemented various theorems from discrete mathematics using Python. Below, you'll find a brief overview of each implemented theorem, along with links to the corresponding Python files.

## Implemented Theorems

### 1. 8m + 1 Theorem
- **File:** [`8m + 1.py`](8m%20%2B%201.py)
- **Description:** This Python script implements the theorem demonstrating that the square of any odd integer can be expressed in the form 8m + 1.

### 2. Fast Ceiling Function
- **File:** [`fast_ceil.py`](fast_ceil.py)
- **Description:** This Python script provides a fast implementation of the ceiling function using mathematical rules instead of iterations.

### 3. Fast Floor Function
- **File:** [`fast_floor.py`](fast_floor.py)
- **Description:** In this file, I've created a fast implementation of the floor function using mathematical rules instead of iterations.

### 4. Ceiling Function
- **File:** [`ceil.py`](ceil.py)
- **Description:** This Python script contains an implementation of the slow ceiling function that follows its exact definition in Discrete Mathematics.

### 5. Floor Function
- **File:** [`floor.py`](floor.py)
- **Description:** This Python script contains a basic implementation of the slow floor function that follows its exact definition in Discrete Mathematics.

### 6. 4q + r Representation
- **File:** [`4q + r.py`](4q%20%2B%20r.py)
- **Description:** Explore the lemma that any integer can be represented as 4q + r, where q is an integer, and r is a number in the range 0 to 3. This Python script provides an implementation of this intriguing mathematical representation.

### 7. Efficient Prime Factorization
- **File:** [`prime_factorization.py`](prime_factorization.py)
- **Description:** This Python script contains an efficient implementation of the Prime Factorization Theorem. The algorithm finds the prime factors of any given number with a time complexity of log(n), achieved through proof by contradiction to optimize iterations.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Explore each Python file to understand the implementations.
3. Run the scripts using a Python interpreter to see the results.
